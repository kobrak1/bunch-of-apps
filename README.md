# React Context API and Routing Project

This project is not a portfolio but serves as a hands-on learning experience for various technologies in a React environment. The main focus areas include using the Context API for state management, incorporating react-router-dom for routing, developing algorithms, and providing basic training in using Sass with React.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Context API Usage:**
   - Explore and implement the Context API in React for efficient state management.

2. **Routing with react-router-dom:**
   - Utilize the `react-router-dom` library to implement client-side routing within the application.

3. **Algorithm Development:**
   - Engage in algorithm development exercises to enhance problem-solving skills within a React application context.

4. **Sass Basics in React:**
   - Learn and apply the fundamentals of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) for styling React components.

## Project Structure

- `src/` directory contains the source code for the React application.
- `context/` directory includes components related to the Context API.
- `components/` directory houses various React components, including algorithm-related exercises.
- `pages/` directory holds React components corresponding to different pages/routes.
- `styles/` directory encompasses Sass files for styling.
